## Asking Smart Questions

Written by Eric Steven Raymond, [How To Ask Questions The Smart Way](http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/smart-questions.html), gives an overview on how to properly interact with the open source community, to properly ask for and get what you want. The act of doing so is summed up as asking “smart” questions.
The main points are:
1. Do as much as you can before asking for help, (Do you need to make a call to the community, or can find the answer yourself?)
2. Be polite, be efficient, and always plan out the formatting of your question. (Do not include unnecessary filler details. Make sure to respond respectfully to those trying to help you.)
3. As a post title, include key aspects of your issue. Such as specific build numbers or versions. (This prevents questions from being asked to narrow down what you want.)
4. Don’t ask for answers to your homework, look for direction and ways to improve.

## Bad Examples

### [Bad Example 1 - Identify all files or folder which contains a specific keyword](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/56770250/identify-all-files-or-folder-which-contains-a-specific-keyword?noredirect=1&lq=1 )

The title of the post states the author’s end goal, but no other relevant information to narrow down the proper solution. The original post simply described what their end goal was strangely worded, to which someone commented “Smells like homework.” The big issue was that the original poster did not include any of their work initially. The same commenter asks the original poster a basic question related to their goal. The original poster unfortunately asks the commenter for the answer, who blows them off by saying that they should search for the answer themselves. More interestingly StackOverflow links to “Good Example 1” below.

### [Bad Example 2 - Is There A Way to Call A Method Using A Variable?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/77041586/is-there-a-way-to-call-a-method-using-a-variable/77041780#77041780 )

Right away the title is missing information such as the language they are using (it is in the post’s tags). The post contains a snippet of their code, with little clarification of what the code is supposed to do and no clarification on how their question will be applied. Every word of the post is strangely capitalized and they use the conjunction “I’ve,” but without the apostrophe. Although they do include what they have tried, albeit without much context, they do not appear to have attempted to find the answer to their question, such as Googling “Call a method using a variable Java.” The post feels extremely lazy and rushed, making it difficult to get a good response.

## Good Examples

### [Good Example 1 - How to find all files containing specific text (string) on Linux?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16956810/how-to-find-all-files-containing-specific-text-string-on-linux/16957078#16957078)

The title of the post states the end goal they want to achieve and the related technology. The post is extremely short, the first line restates the goal they are trying to achieve, and directly they include their attempt and why it is considered a failure. The poster demonstrates that they have attempted their best and are stuck on this issue. This is good since the poster has both sincerity and the will to learn.

### [Good Example 2 - How do I check if an array includes a value in JavaScript?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/237104/how-do-i-check-if-an-array-includes-a-value-in-javascript)

At first thought, this seemed like a simple question that the user could have just searched up on their own, but after reading through the post it is not. The poster is looking for the most efficient way to check whether or not a certain value exists in an array. The poster includes not only their attempt but a link to a post with a similar question. This is a good post because it involves possible responders to think for a well-thought-out answer.

## Closing Thoughts

After reading How To Ask Questions The Smart Way, I became more accustomed to recognizing how certain questions are “bad” or “not smart.” Although I am judging others' ability to ask questions, I remain untested. For the time being, I believe that my ability to ask “smart” questions is insufficient. The ability to communicate effectively and ask good questions is what will make you a better programmer. In summary, you will receive what you deserve and will get an answer according to what you asked.
