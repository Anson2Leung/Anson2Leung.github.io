Before ICS 314 I had little to no experience with JavaScript. The little experience I have with JavaScript came from when I helped my brother over the summer, when he tried learning Javascript using NeetCode. Although I did not know much about JavaScript, I have experience coding with Java, so the learning process was not as daunting as I once believed. My first experience was using FreeCodeCamp, which introduced the basics of JavaScript. It was a good learning resource, but it quickly became a slog to follow along. Although I did pick up key concepts, when the prompts got longer and tedious, I stopped acquiring and retaining new knowledge.

Based on my experience with coding, I do not know what makes a good language for software development. From my experience with Javascript I currently believe that JavaScript is a decent language to use for software development, for the reason being that it can be used for both the frontend and backend of a project.

Aside from using FreeCodeCamp, in my ICS 314 class we have WODs (“Workout of the Day) which are very short athletic software engineering exercises. Although describing my performance as “not exceptional” is a nice way to describe my coding abilities, those exercises get my brain moving and it is quite fun to solve them. I believe this method of learning how to code is really beneficial to solidifying your abilities, but it is unlikely that I will learn new coding strategies just by doing WODs. So personally, this method of learning will not be as great of a learning tool after I become more experienced.
