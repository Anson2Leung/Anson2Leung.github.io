Before ICS 314 I believe I had little to no experience with JavaScript. The little experience I have with JavaScript came from when I helped my brother over the summer, when he tried learning Javascript with NeetCode. Although I do not know much about JavaScript, I have experience with Java, so the learning process was not extremely daunting. 

FreeCodeCamp was a good introduction to JavaScript for me, but it started becoming a slog to complete each one. Although I did pick up key concepts, when the challenges got longer and tedious, I stopped acquiring and retaining that knowledge.

So far I do not know what makes a good language for software development and engineers. What I believe currently is that JavaScript is quite decent to use for software development, since it can be used for both the frontend and backend of a project.

In my ICS 314 class we have WODs (â€œWorkout of the Day) which are very short athletic software engineering exercises. Although my performance being not exceptional is a nice way to describe my coding abilities, those exercises get my brain moving and it is quite fun to solve them. I believe this method of learning how to code is really beneficial to solidifying your abilities, but it is unlikely that I will learn new coding strategies just by doing WODs. So personally this method of learning is currently very beneficial for me, but will not be as great of a learning tool after I become more experienced.
