## Overview
On August 30th, Kevin Costa from Business Solution Technologies, came to UH Manoa to be a guest for the Tech Industry Guest Talk. Unfortunately due to already having other business I had to take care of, resulting in missing the first quarter of the presentation, but I believe that I did not miss anything important during that time. I watched the presentation given by Kevin Costa through Zoom, which although gave me more freedom to where I can watch it, allowing me to watch without distractions, but it limited the intractability with the speaker.

## My take-aways
Mr. Costa discussed the basic framework and key points of a software development team. The key take-away I had from his talk was the importance of communication in the development process. Communication is what allows for the team to work efficiently and effectively allowing for goals to be reached. The same applies to the communications with the client, citing the agile framework for development. Which is the process of Gather requirement, -> design -> prototype -> refine requirements -> refine design-> prototype 2 -> repeat. Nowadays a software product is not completed the moment it's deployed, improvements can always be made, continuing the agile framework cycle.

## Final thoughts
My favorite moment was near the beginning where he says something along the lines of “how much will you remember of my talk” which is completely true, since I have already forgotten certain things that he said. Overall Mr. Costa was a valuable speaker to attend for me as a ICS 314 student, but I believe it would not be as valuable for a person who already has experience within the field.
