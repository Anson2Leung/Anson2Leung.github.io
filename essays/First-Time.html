<h2 id="a-little-bit-of-background">A Little Bit of Background</h2>
<p>As mentioned in “A Novice’s Thoughts on JavaScript,” I have very little experience with JavaScript and slight suggestions that I, compared to others, have very little experience with coding as a whole. I started my computer science journey in Junior year of high school, tempted by all the interesting things software developers do (and the accompanying salary).</p>
<h2 id="previous-experience">Previous “Experience”</h2>
<p>All of my experiences in coding come from the classroom, with the most challenging course I have taken so far being ICS 212 with Professor Ravi. ICS 212 was a class that worked with C/C++, with a strong emphasis in writing readable code. It was difficult, but was a great learning experience in algorithmic thinking. 
But what I learned so far through my classes did not provide me with experience in writing code for a project. All assignments so far were guided coding problems, where we are given a guide and parameters for a solution. I personally have never had to decide, which language I should use or a particular solution I wanted to do.</p>
<h2 id="expectations">Expectations</h2>
<p>For now I expect to learn how to use common frameworks used in the industry, such as  Meteor, Github, and React. By learning about these programs, tools, and frameworks, I will be able to apply them to future Computer Science related endeavors.</p>
