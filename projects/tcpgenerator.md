# Overview
The main goal of this assignment from ICS 211 was to develop a program that can read a binary file (containing information of a TCP header), generate a TCP response header, and to write the TCP response header into a binary file.

This assignment also tested your knowledge of bit-wise operators, as they were necessary in creating the response header.

# Final Thoughts
What I learned from this project was that I had quite the hard time with pointers. It took me a long time to understand the uses between pointers and dereferences (since they both are signaled with an astrisk).
