## Overview
The final coding assignment in ICS 212, Spring 2023. The project helped me learn how to read and write data into a txt file.

This project is in two parts: one in C which was made roughly a few months before, and the other which was to convert our C code to C++.

Using a linked list to store information, allowing for a user to interact and add new entries or remove entries in the linked list data base. 

When the user is done, the data is saved into a txt file, which will be read upon the next startup of the program.
